### **Installation**
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

‚û°Ô∏è **Clone the Repository:**
First, clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url> # Replace with your actual repository URL
cd gato-frontend
```

üì¶ **Install Dependencies:**
Next, install all the required Node.js packages using your preferred package manager:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

‚öôÔ∏è **Environment Configuration:**
Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory. This file will hold your environment-specific variables. Copy the example file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Open the newly created `.env` file and set the base URL for your backend API. If not specified, it will default to `http://localhost:8080`.
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```
*Note: Providing an empty string (e.g., `VITE_API_BASE_URL=`) allows Vite's proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts` to handle API requests prefixed with `/api` by forwarding them to `http://localhost:8080`.*

### **Usage**
Once installed and configured, you can start the development server and interact with the application.

1.  **Start the Development Server:**
    Execute the following command to launch the Vite development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will typically become available in your web browser at `http://localhost:5173`.

2.  **Register a New Account:**
    Navigate to the `/register` page in your browser. Fill in the required fields: a display name, a valid email address, and a strong password. After successful registration, you will be automatically redirected to the login page.

3.  **Log In to Your Account:**
    Proceed to the `/login` page. Enter the email and password you used during registration. Upon successful authentication, the application will direct you to your personalized dashboard.

4.  **Explore the Dashboard:**
    The dashboard (`/dashboard`) provides a concise overview of your player profile. Here, you can view your display name, email, accumulated points, current streak count, and any badges you have earned.

5.  **Manage Your Todos (Quest Log):**
    Access the `/todos` page to manage your personal list of tasks, presented as a "Quest Log."
    *   **View Quests:** Review all your existing tasks, noting their status (completed or pending).
    *   **Add New Quest:** Utilize the "New Quest" form to add new tasks. Each quest requires a title and can optionally include additional notes for detailed descriptions.
    *   **Complete Quests:** Mark tasks as complete with a simple click. The application provides visual feedback for completed items.

### **Features**
*   üöÄ **User Authentication:** Robust registration and login flows, securing user access and managing session tokens.
*   üë§ **Personalized Dashboard:** Displays a dynamic user profile, including display name, email, game points, streak counts, and collectible badges.
*   ‚úÖ **Todo Management (Quest Log):** Comprehensive CRUD operations for tasks (create, list, update/complete), enhancing productivity.
*   ‚ú® **Arcade-Inspired UI:** A unique and visually engaging user interface, meticulously crafted with custom fonts, thematic colors, and Tailwind CSS for a retro-modern aesthetic.
*   ‚ö° **Fast Development Environment:** Leverages Vite for an incredibly fast development server, optimized builds, and efficient hot module reloading.
*   üîÑ **State Management with React Query:** Efficient asynchronous data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend API, ensuring a smooth user experience.
*   üõ°Ô∏è **Protected Routes:** Implements client-side route protection, restricting access to core application features (Dashboard, Todos) to authenticated users only.
